# Med-Manager-final

This is my final submission of the latest Andela Learning Community 2.0 challenge as requested.
I used the users local Calendar to store data on the medications, but also an in app sqlite using ROOM API that is used to store that
information also.

Syncing/Backup is automatic with basic users google calendar settings, but there is also a backup/sync option in the menu in
app for user to back up manually to google whenever they wish, back is based on users account.

User can delete medications also, not just create and sync them.

Ringtone of the alarm is based on the users personally prefered ringtone for events from calendar, they can set it whenever they want
in normal settings and application will comply.

3rd party libraries:
- Only used one for showing the calendar in month view (the dates with medications will apear when the user clicks a medication
 on the "List Medication" items..... The days with medications if not the current date are marked with blue dots.
